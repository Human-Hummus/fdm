<div style="line-height:2.0;"> 
	<p style="text-indent:50px;">Sorry that this reads like a Reddit fanfic lol</p>

	<br>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;">You're awoken, it's bright... and dark? <q>Hello!</q> , says someone. <q>Hello?</q> you say, <q>What's happened?</q> . <q>The assignment has called you to my realm</q> , he says, in a matter-of-fact tone. <q>What?</q> <q>We'll get to it later; for now, look around</q> . You do so. Again, it's hard to determine what exactly surrounds you, but it's certainly interesting. <q>HumanHummus</q> , says a spinning... banner? There's some other bits of text scattered about, contrasted against a blinding neon background.</p>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;">Looking around has all <em>but</em> clarified the scenario you find yourself in. You inquire further, <q>Let me ask again, <b>WHAT</b> is going on‽ </q> <q>You've arrived at <a href="www.humanhummus.com">humanhummus.com!</a> </q> , he says... Wait a second, <em>he</em> ? You look to your right, there's a strange picture of a monster-esque creature. <q>Pretty neat, right? UwU</q> , the picture says.</p>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;"><q>Who are you?</q> , you ask, with what feels like the millionth question. <q>Oh, right, I'm the Drungalwort; keeper of this realm.</q> The response was unclear, to say the least. Thus, you ask yet <em>another</em> question, <q>What is a Drungalwort?</q> <q> I'm so glad you asked.</q> The monster, or rather, <em>the Drungalwort</em> , proceeds to reach over and click... itself. <b>FLASH!</b></p>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;">A slightly different environment reveals itself. <q> This is me! I'm the Drungalwort, pronouns he/he</q> , he gestures to a button that says <q>Pronouns he/he</q> followed by a picture of Michael Jackson. <q> Click it!</q> says the Drungalwort. So you do, a deafaning laughing sound plays. Ah, he/he, Michael Jackson? It's a bad joke.</p>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;"><q>So... Drungalwort</q> , you start, <q>what am I doing here exactly?</q> . The creature replies, <q>You're here to finish an assignment, but that's besides the point at the moment, wanna play some games?</q> <q>Sure, I guess?</q> you reply, unsure of what to say. <q>click on the games button!</q> says the Drungalwort. You your eyes are still overwhelmed by the inundation of colors. Eventually though, you locate the button that says <q>Gamez</q> . You stop. Where are your hands? Where is your body? How will you press the button? You <em>did</em> press a button before, thus it's possible, but how? <q><b>Where is my body‽ </b> </q> you ask, panicked. The Drungalwort replies promptly, <q>online, you have no body, only mind and soul, you simply will your actions into fruition.</q> You <em>imagine(?)</em> yourself pressing the button, and you do. <b>FLASH!</b></p>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;">Again the environment changes. You're still pretty disturbed by your lack of a pysical self, but there's not much to be done now. In any case, The display before you hosts an array of strange images accompanied by miscellaneous text. <q> pick one!</q> , says the Drungalwort. You gaze upon the slurry of options, but one in particular catches your eye <q> Drungy speak?</q> you say, questioningly. <q>Yes, that's my voice</q> says the Drungalwort. You pause for a moment. How had you not noticed, until now, that the Drungalwort had no voice, that <em>you</em> , in fact, had no voice? The communication was somewhat telepathic? Curiosity got the better of you, and in hopes of answering these questions, you click the button. <b>FLASH!</b></p>

	<p style="text-indent:50px;">Yet again, a screen appears before you, with a text prompt, a <q>speed</q> slider, and a <q>submit query</q> button. You notice that the Drungalwort is gone. <q>hello?</q> you ask. <q>what's up</q> he replies from the ether. <q>Alright, cool, that's normal</q> you think to yourself. The Drungalwort prompts you, <q>Just type in what you want me to say, and I'll say it!</q> . You think for a moment, and decide you want him to say <q>test</q> . You're not sure how you're going to enter the text, but based on the previous encounter, you decide to simply will the text into the box, and that seems to work. You press submit and in a second, there's a play button. You click play, and a grating, largely uninteligable voice says <q>test</q> . Having gotten the message you're now curious. You again click the button that says <q>gamez</q> . <b>FLASH!</b></p>
